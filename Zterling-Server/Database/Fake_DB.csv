,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",,Fake, ,1.3807741554959532

IPL 2023 - Sunrisers' right-handedness a glaring issue - Tom Moody | ESPNcricinfo,"The Sunrisers Hyderabad batting has come under scrutiny after their five-wicket defeat in Lucknow. They scored only 121 on a slow and low pitch that assisted the Super Giants spinners, and their former title-winning head coach Tom Moody said their largely right-handed line-up was a problem.

""The thing that screams out to me is that they left the auction table knowing they had a team full of right-handers,"" Moody said on ESPNcricinfo's T20 Time Out. ""They released a left-hander in Nicholas Pooran who hit the winning run [for Lucknow on Friday] and they brought someone who was 30% more expensive, who is a right-hander [Harry Brook]....similar sort of impact player.


""They left out Abhishek Sharma, a left-hander, so there's a lot of things to unpack. When they're going to play on surfaces like that ... when there is that tendency where you can be exposed by being very one dimensional on slow turning tracks, you are sitting ducks.""

Against Lucknow, the Sunrisers XI had just one left-hand batter - Washington Sundar - having dropped Abhishek Sharma for Anmolpreet Singh. Last season, Sunrisers had Abhishek, Washington and Nicholas Pooran as left handers in their line-up.

Lucknow's spinners thrived against Sunrisers' right-handers, with left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya, and legspinners Amit Mishra and Ravi Bishnoi all spinning the ball away from the batter. They were the only bowlers to complete their full quota for Lucknow, and finished with combined figures of 12-0-64-6.",www.espncricinfo.com,Fake,www.espncricinfo.com IPL 2023 - Sunrisers' right-handedness a glaring issue - Tom Moody | ESPNcricinfo,1.2421307413154428
