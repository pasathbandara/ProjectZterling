news = '''Virat Kohli reached his first international century since November 2019, as he reached the three-figure mark against Afghanistan in Asia Cup 2022. Team India's star batter Virat Kohli ended the wait for an international century, reaching the three-figure mark against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup Super 4 match in Dubai. Kohli reached his hundred in 53 balls, continuing on his impressive run of form since his return to Team India in the continental tournament. Before the century knock, Kohli had scored two fifties in the Asia Cup as well (59* against Hong Kong and 60 against Pakistan). Kohli's last century in international cricket came in November 2019 against Bangladesh; last month, the batter had endured a thousand days without a ton. The century against Afghanistan was Kohli's 71st international hundred, as he equalled Australia's batting great Ricky Ponting. Only Sachin Tendulkar (100 international centuries) stays ahead of the former India captain now.
In the game against Afghanistan, Kohli opened the innings alongside stand-in skipper KL Rahul as Rohit Sharma was given rest in the game. This was the first time Kohli came as an opener in T20Is since March 2021, when he had forged a brilliant 94-run stand with Rohit; it was an even better outing for the former Indian captain this time, as he forged a 119-run stand with Rahul, who also scored a much-needed half-century (62 off 40 deliveries). Kohli began aggressively in his knock, racing to his half-century in 32 deliveries. Following the quick dismissals of Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav (6), the 33-year-old batter readjusted his game alongside Rishabh Pant, resorting to singles and doubles through the middle-overs before upping the ante against Afghanistan pacers. He eventually reached his century in the 19th over of the game with a six against Fareed Ahmed â€“ this was his maiden T20I hundred.
Kohli eventually remained unbeaten on 122 runs off 61 deliveries, smashing 12 fours and six sixes en route to his century knock.'''

After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president.
